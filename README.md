# Upoint Query Replicator

Writing the same SQL queries with different data too many times is a time-consuming and tedious chore for our team. It is also more prone to make mistakes, which demands more work from our crew.
So here is my solution that solves most of the concerns by replicating the SQL queries that we need by accepting minimal inputs and generating queries in minutes rather than hours/days doing it manually, and it greatly reduces/eliminates the risks of errors.


## Features
- Good an nice looking UI.
- This is PWA (preogressive web app) tool which will work as a website and also can be easily installed as a web app in seconds by one click.
- This can also be used without internet. 
- It makes our team work easier.
- This our team to concentrate on more exciting tasks.
- This eradicates the probability that you'll make errors, which is highly probable when performing it manually.
- Keeps track of who and for whom queries are produced, which will come in handy if there are any issues about those changes in the future.
